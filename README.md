# Real-time multiplayer shooter game

This project was developed as the final project for the [Evolution Scala Bootcamp](https://github.com/evolution-gaming/scala-bootcamp). It features both a TypeScript-based frontend game and a Scala backend server.

### Overview

Although the bootcamp focused on Scala, I challenged myself to build the game frontend from scratch using TypeScript and the HTML5 Canvas API without any game engines or external libraries. The frontend is structured around the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, a common pattern in game development.

The backend is implemented in Scala using http4s, providing both a RESTful API and WebSocket support for real-time multiplayer gameplay.

### Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay via WebSockets
- Custom ECS-based game engine in TypeScript
- RESTful API for game management (demo purposes)
- No external game engines or libraries used
